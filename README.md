## Architecture

```
Discord Bot (dumb client)
    ↓ HTTP/WebSocket
API Server (gateway.js:3005)
    ↓
Orchestrator (RouterAgent + Persona Routing)
    ↓
20 Agents (Rag, Coder, Socratic, Manim, Vision, Debate, ...)
    ↓
7-tier RAG Pipeline
    ↓
SQLite Vector Store (domain-filtered) + BM25 + Knowledge Graph
```

### Tier System
- **Tier 1**: Persona Routing (Therapist vs Technical) — skip RAG for casual chat
- **Tier 2**: Decoupled Orchestrator — REST API independent of Discord
- **Tier 3**: T-Shaped Learning — deep (spaced repetition) + broad (RSS news)
- **Tier 4**: Career Agent — interview prep, job scraper, outreach drafting
